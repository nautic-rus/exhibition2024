  { "title": "Concept design", "content": "After receiving a technical requirements from a customer, a designer develops a concept design. The concept design includes a preliminary hull lines development, a general arrangement, a building specification, main equipment suggestions, a preliminary makers list, the estimated weight of the Vessel as well as other supporting documents." },
  { "title": "Class drawings", "content": "The class drawings for the vessel are developed after the customer approves the concept design. The class drawings include a set of documents, calculations, drawings, explanations to be sent to the RMRS for approval according to the classification and sea vessels rules." },
  { "title": "Workshop design documentation", "content": "The development of workshop drawings, intended for the shipyard as a detailed – how to build manual, are developed by the Design Bureau as the individual class drawings are approved by the owner and the class society. Having the opportunity to have this done within the same office as the class drawings is a clear benefit for all parties. The likelihood of misinterpretation of the class drawing are reduced, if not eliminated and the likelihood of the ship being constructed as the Designer intended it to be are secured. The workshop drawings and documentation span the entirety of the Vessel from the Hull, Systems, Electrical Installations and Outfitting." },
  { "title": "3D-Modelling", "content": "Modern ship design is impossible without creating a high-quality 3D model. The detailed 3D model is the basis on which all design solutions are worked out and the necessary calculations of the vessel are performed. It helps to prevent possible design errors and allows you to produce workshop design documentation of a high degree of elaboration. Proper use and updating of the 3D model allows you to reduce the time and costs during the construction of the vessel." },
  { "title": "Nesting documentation", "content": "Nesting documentation is developed based on the 3D ship model. It includes parts cutting, profile sketches, cutting with marking, profile and plate details bending sketches. Fitting drawings are also provided as needed." },
  { "title": "Operational and tests/trials documentation", "content": "Workshop design documentation is intended for the ship structure study and its’ operational rules. Tests/trials documentation is the documentation including permittance documentation granting a right for construction and assembly works on the one hand, and as-built documentation, confirming the actual performance of the construction and assembly works in a scope set in the class drawing, on the other." },
  { "title": "Designer supervision", "content": "Designer supervision is a planned control system of a design bureau. Designer supervision is an integral part of the design work. When building and repairing any ship, questions on the initial project amendments often arise. They can be related to some other equipment and materials appliance, construction improvements, and cost reduction. According to the customer’s wish, we can as well provide technical support of our engineers with a documentation update and its approval in the state bodies." },
  { "title": "Ship reclassification", "content": "Ship reclassification or ship class change is a procedure of technical expertise and inspection aimed to change or issue old registry certificates for the new ones." },
  { "title": "Ship upgrading and reequipment", "content": "Upgrading is a measure aimed at ship construction or element changing. This measure is taken to improve technical characteristics, work and life conditions, and International conventions requirements fulfillment." }
